🅿️📡 **Pitch**: A smart parking system that detects parking spot occupancy using sensors and provides real-time availability data through a cloud-based platform. Perfect for modern urban parking management.

## Key Features
- Real-time parking spot occupancy detection
- Sensor integration for vehicle presence
- Cloud data storage and management
- Mobile-friendly dashboard
- Occupancy history and analytics
- Cost-effective IoT solution

## Quick Start (60 Seconds)
1. Prepare hardware: sensors, microcontroller, network connectivity
2. Configure cloud backend (Firebase, AWS, or similar)
3. Deploy sensor firmware
4. Access dashboard to monitor parking availability

## Use Cases
- Urban parking management
- Shopping mall parking solutions
- Hospital and airport parking
- Residential parking complexes
- Educational institution parking
